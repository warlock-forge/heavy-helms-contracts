# Heavy Helms

## Features

- Modular contract system that enables new games modes to be added in the future without losing any player state or migrating any contracts 
- Decentralized game design allows for creators to build their own custom game modes - no permission needed (unless you want to modify player state üõ°Ô∏è). NFT makers can even create and sell custom skins that can be equipped by players using the Player contract SkinRegistry system
- Permissioned whitelist system unlocks the ability for game contracts to change player state (increment record, set player status to dead üßü <- opt in hardcore game mode, etc.) if approved by Player contract owner
- Players can create their own characters and customize them by collecting unique skins - or equip one from our default collection. The skin you have equipped determines your Weapon, Armor, and Combat Stance - so choose wisely
- No pay to win! All players have the same amount of total attribute points - they are just distributed differently. Skins do not provide any comptetitive advantage as Weapon and Armor choices are not locked behind expensive skins
- Fully onchain versioned game engine that handles all game logic - including combat mechanics such as initiative, hit chance, blocks and counters, etc. Also accounts for player attributes in damage calculations, Weapon and Armor modifiers, etc.
- The game engine is a view that returns an encoded byte string which contains the results of all of the rounds of combat - each round result is encoded in to 8 bytes. For example the results of a 10 round fight take up only 80 bytes (well 87 bytes if you include the 7 byte prefix that contains the winning player ID, game version, and win condition ü§ì)
- The Practice game mode allows us to leverage the fact that game engine is a view. We use some blockchain derived pseudo randomness to simulate a fight completely gas free. Our game client gets those combat bytes, decodes them, and shows the user a fun fight. Of course we do not modify player state - this is practice after all
- The Duel mode takes Practice mode to the next level - even allowing players to wager on the result if they so choose - using a unique initiate/accept challenge flow. This game mode uses VRF to ensure fairness and cleverly escrows any wager amounts until the duel is complete
- That Duel now lives forever on the blokchain in the emit'ed event logs. Since we store all of the fight results in a bytes string (including game engine version) the game client can display to the user the exact state of that fight (inclduing what skin the players had equipped, etc.).
